    questions:
      - question: What Is Regenerative Agriculture?
        answer: "## In addition to a long list of incredible benefits for farmers and their crops, regenerative agriculture practices help us fight the climate crisis by pulling carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it in the ground.\n\nWe know that to solve the climate crisis, business as usual will not cut it. Not in electricity production. Not in industry. Not in transportation. And certainly not in agriculture.\n\nThe agriculture sector is one of the biggest emitters of CO2, the greenhouse gas (GHG) most responsible for the changes we are seeing in our climate today. Together with forestry and other land use, agriculture is responsible for just under\_25 percent\_of all human-created GHG emissions.\n\nBut it also has a vital role to play in helping us end this crisis, and create a safe, sustainable future without carbon pollution. One where we can provide our booming world population with fresh, healthy food grown in a sustainable soil ecosystem.\n\nSure, it may seem like a contradiction. So don’t take it from us –\_[take it from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3\\_ar5\\_chapter11.pdf): “Leveraging the mitigation potential in the \\[Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use] sector is extremely important in meeting emission reduction targets.”\n\nBut how?\n\nWe’ve got two words for you:\_**regenerative agriculture**.\n"
      - question: How do refunds and returns work?
        answer: >-
          It happens. Even the most beautiful of plants will disappoint
          *someone*. Again, tell it like it is:

            - All discounted items sales are final.
            - If you’d like another version of your item, please use the return label. Instructions are printed on its back.
            - If your item is damaged or not functioning correctly, email us at info@planty.com, and we’ll refund you + send you a new one ASAP!
      - question: How do you handle sensitive customer information?

          am I right? Make sure you’re as transparent as possible with your data
          handling process. Or, if you’re using Snipcart, just refer to [our ToS
          and DPA](http://bit.ly/2YJwlyt).

          Q: Why is this Planty theme so beautiful? <br /> A: We hired our first
          designer a couple of months ago. <br /><br /> Q: Why did you build a
          theme for Stackbit? <br /> A: We believe in Stackbit’s promise of
          opening up the JAMstack to more developers. Plus, we trust these
          folks. [Read more about Stackbit](http://bit.ly/2YAvGix). <br /><br />
          Q: How many people work at Snipcart? <br /> A: Not a lot! We’re a
          small, bootstrapped team of eight human beings. Michael might be a
          robot, though. <br /><br /> Q: Why is Snipcart based in Québec City?
          <br /> A: Have you been here? It’s beaaautiful! <br /><br /> Q: What’s
          the meaning of life? <br /> A: We’re not quite sure. But building
          useful products with people we love feels meaningful enough.
