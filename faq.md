      - question: What Is Regenerative Agriculture?
        answer: "## In addition to a long list of incredible benefits for farmers and their crops, regenerative agriculture practices help us fight the climate crisis by pulling carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it in the ground.\n\nWe know that to solve the climate crisis, business as usual will not cut it. Not in electricity production. Not in industry. Not in transportation. And certainly not in agriculture.\n\nThe agriculture sector is one of the biggest emitters of CO2, the greenhouse gas (GHG) most responsible for the changes we are seeing in our climate today. Together with forestry and other land use, agriculture is responsible for just under\_25 percent\_of all human-created GHG emissions.\n\nBut it also has a vital role to play in helping us end this crisis, and create a safe, sustainable future without carbon pollution. One where we can provide our booming world population with fresh, healthy food grown in a sustainable soil ecosystem.\n\nSure, it may seem like a contradiction. So don’t take it from us –\_[take it from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3\\_ar5\\_chapter11.pdf): “Leveraging the mitigation potential in the \\[Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use] sector is extremely important in meeting emission reduction targets.”\n\nBut how?\n\nWe’ve got two words for you:\_**regenerative agriculture**.\n"
      - question: How It Works?
        answer: "In short, regenerative agriculture is a system of farming principles and practices that seeks to rehabilitate and enhance the entire ecosystem of the farm by placing a heavy premium on soil health with attention also paid to water management, fertilizer use, and more. It is a method of farming that “improves the resources it uses, rather than destroying or depleting them,”\_[according to the Rodale Institute](https://rodaleinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/rodale-white-paper.pdf).\n\nA great deal of emphasis is placed on looking holistically at the agro-ecosystem. Key techniques include:\n\n*   **Conservation tillage:**\_Plowing and tillage dramatically erode soil and release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. They also can result in the kind of bare or compacted soil that creates a hostile environment for important soil microbes. By adopting low- or no-till practices, farmers minimize physical disturbance of the soil, and over time increase levels of soil organic matter, creating healthier, more resilient environments for plants to thrive, as well as keeping more and more carbon where it belongs.\n\n*   **Diversity:**\_Different plants release different carbohydrates (sugars) through their roots, and various microbes feed on these carbs and return all sorts of different nutrients back to the plant and the soil. By increasing the plant diversity of their fields, farmers help create the rich, varied, and nutrient-dense soils that lead to more productive yields.\n\n*   **Rotation and cover crops:\_**Left exposed to the elements, soil will erode and the nutrients necessary for successful plant growth will either dry out or quite literally wash away. At the same time, planting the same plants in the same location can lead to a buildup of some nutrients and a lack of others. But by rotating crops and deploying cover crops strategically, farms and gardens can infuse soils with more and more (and more diverse) soil organic matter, often while avoiding disease and pest problems naturally. Always remember, bare soil is bad soil.\n\n*   **Mess with it less:**\_In addition to minimizing physical disturbance, regenerative agriculture practitioners also often seek to be cautious about chemical or biological activities that also can damage long-term soil health. Misapplication of fertilizers and other soil amendments can disrupt the natural relationship between microorganisms and plant roots.\n\n*The overriding theme:\_If you take care of your soil, it will take care of you.*\n\n[According to Kiss the Ground](https://kisstheground.com/regenerative-agriculture-partone/), a nonprofit organization devoted to sustainable farming practices that improve soil health, “If regenerative means: ‘renewal, restoration, and growth of cells, organisms, and ecosystems,’ or ‘renewal or restoration of a body, bodily part, or biological system (as in a forest) after injury or as a normal process,’ then regenerative agriculture is agriculture that is doing just that.”\n\nThe benefits of doing so are numerous: Regenerative agriculture practices increase soil biodiversity and organic matter, leading to more resilient soils that can better withstand climate change impacts like flooding and drought. Healthy soils beget strong yields and nutrient-rich crops. It also diminishes erosion and runoff, leading to improved water quality on and off the farm.\n\nImportantly, regenerative agriculture practices also help us fight the climate crisis by pulling carbon from the atmosphere and sequestering it in the ground.\_\n"

          Q: Why is this Planty theme so beautiful? <br /> A: We hired our first
          designer a couple of months ago. <br /><br /> Q: Why did you build a
          theme for Stackbit? <br /> A: We believe in Stackbit’s promise of
          opening up the JAMstack to more developers. Plus, we trust these
          folks. [Read more about Stackbit](http://bit.ly/2YAvGix). <br /><br />
          Q: How many people work at Snipcart? <br /> A: Not a lot! We’re a
          small, bootstrapped team of eight human beings. Michael might be a
          robot, though. <br /><br /> Q: Why is Snipcart based in Québec City?
          <br /> A: Have you been here? It’s beaaautiful! <br /><br /> Q: What’s
          the meaning of life? <br /> A: We’re not quite sure. But building
          useful products with people we love feels meaningful enough.
